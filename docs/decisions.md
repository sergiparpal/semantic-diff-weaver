# Decisions and compatibility record

## MVP fixed decisions

- Configuration is optional and conservative defaults provide first-run output.
- Evidence is batched by module under per-call bounds and an eight-call total ceiling.
- Low-confidence material risk is presented as a review question; below-threshold findings become
  visible omissions/limitations.
- Exact names, Git rename metadata, signatures, normalized fingerprints, and conservative similarity
  support symbol matching without forced ambiguous matches.
- Deterministic fallback is enabled by default.
- Stable behavior fingerprints plus low materiality classify refactors; otherwise the strongest
  supported category or `unknown_semantic_change` is used.
- The handler always returns JSON text, including Markdown-only mode.
- The user's active Hermes provider/model/profile is used without routing overrides.
- The plugin registers one standalone tool and no hooks, commands, skills, or overrides.

## Compatibility snapshot (2026-07-18)

- Local test runtime: CPython 3.12.3 on Linux.
- Local Git: 2.43.0.
- Hermes Agent 0.14.0 was installed in an isolated environment and passed pip-entry-point and
  temporary-home directory discovery, registration, and exact-tool smoke tests.
- Hermes Agent 0.13.0 was tested as the only earlier published release and failed the required
  contract because `PluginContext.register_tool` lacks the `override` parameter. PyPI's release index
  begins at 0.13.0, so 0.14.0 is the lowest verified compatible release.
- The current Hermes Agent 0.18.2 release was also installed and passed the same discovery and
  registration checks. It requires Python `>=3.11,<3.14`; this project remains Python `>=3.11` and
  does not force-install or pin the host runtime.
- `PluginContext.register_tool` accepts `name`, `toolset`, `schema`, `handler`, optional checks/env,
  async/description/emoji fields, and `override=False`.
- `PluginLlm.complete_structured` accepts `instructions`, typed `input`, `json_schema`, `schema_name`,
  request shaping (`temperature`, `max_tokens`, `timeout`, `purpose`), and gated routing overrides.
  This plugin supplies no provider, model, agent, or profile override.
- Directory and pip entry-point discovery remain opt-in; project plugins require
  `HERMES_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS`.

The CI compatibility matrix installs Hermes 0.14.0 and 0.18.2 with the built plugin wheel, then
repeats both real discovery paths for each version. The regular fake-context suite continues to
validate registration without requiring Hermes or a live model.

## Output-affecting corrections (2026-07-25)

These change what an existing repository is reported as, so they are recorded here rather than only
in the changelog.

- Conditions are classified by their changed expressions, never by the enclosing symbol name. The
  synthetic `<module>` and `<unparsed>` names were read as containing `<` and `>` comparison
  operators, forcing every module-scope or unparsed condition to `boundary_change` or
  `retry_timeout_change` ahead of the authorization, validation, and retry-guard rules. A
  module-scope authorization guard now reports impact 92 instead of 64, with the obligation
  scenarios and candidate-test terminology that follow from the corrected category.
- PEP 695 type parameters are part of the signature contract for both callables and classes.
  `def f[T]` to `def f[T, U]`, or an added bound such as `[T: int]`, previously fingerprinted
  identically, was labelled `structural_refactor`, and was then dropped under the default
  `emit_low_risk_refactors: false`. Such changes are now `signature_change`.
- A scalar `language:` section is a `configuration_error` with remediation text instead of an
  `AttributeError` surfacing as an opaque `internal_error`.
- The AST analysis deadline bounds matching and comparison as well as parsing, and is reached
  inclusively, so a spent or zero budget stops work on platforms with a coarse monotonic clock.
- The reviewed evaluation goldens required no regeneration: no corpus case contains a module-scope
  condition or PEP 695 syntax. Schema version, taxonomy values, error codes, and evidence IDs are
  unchanged.

## Release note

The repository is licensed under MIT. Publishing or pushing remains a separately authorized action.

## Evaluation label review (2026-07-17)

The retry-predicate fixture originally listed `state_transition_change` even though its increment
statement was identical at both revisions. The expected label was removed after the required separate
fixture review so evaluation does not reward an unsupported state-change finding.

## Plan-conformance closure (2026-07-19)

- Callable signatures now include return annotations and type comments; decorator evidence retains
  safe names only.
- Symbol inventory distinguishes methods and async methods, always records a module snapshot, and
  preserves overload-style duplicate qualified names.
- Matching now performs a conservative second pass across changed files, while ambiguous near-ties
  remain separate findings with explicit warnings and reduced confidence.
- Equivalent obligations merge by normalized Given/When/Then semantics, union behavior links and
  candidate tests, preserve the strongest priority/confidence, and retain the global candidate cap.
- LLM batching connects same-module evidence and cross-module changes sharing a changed dependency
  call before applying input and call ceilings.
- Candidate-test discovery now has aggregate file and byte safety caps, and the full deterministic
  performance regression ceiling is five seconds as required by the project performance
  specification.
  Performance fixtures pause coverage tracing while timed application code runs, so the ceiling
  consistently measures production execution rather than instrumentation overhead across systems.
- Committed tree metadata and source blobs are collected in bounded Git plumbing batches instead of
  spawning size/read/mode processes per file; literal pathspecs and disabled lazy fetching preserve
  the repository boundary while meeting the cross-platform performance target.
- All 17 evaluation cases now have reviewed, normalized canonical JSON goldens in addition to their
  machine-readable category/evidence/scenario labels.

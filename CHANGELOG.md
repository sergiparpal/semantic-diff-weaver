# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Rename the project from `hermes-semantic-diff-weaver` to `semantic-diff-weaver`. The distribution,
  the `semantic_diff_weaver` package, and the plugin entry-point name all drop the `hermes-` prefix.
- **Breaking:** rename the `HERMES_SEMANTIC_DIFF_WEAVER_ALLOWED_ROOTS` environment variable to
  `SEMANTIC_DIFF_WEAVER_ALLOWED_ROOTS`. The old name is no longer read; hosts that set it lose the
  extra authorized roots and fall back to the process working directory.
- Harden secret egress, model-data framing, terminal/control rendering, repository authorization,
  Git replacement-object handling, inherited Git environment isolation, configuration complexity,
  and adversarial AST resource limits.
- Read per-file hunks with one bounded Git command per path chunk instead of one process per
  changed file, keeping the previous single-path semantics via `--no-renames` and falling back to
  the per-file reader for any path Git does not report. Analysis output is unchanged.
- Remove redundant work from candidate-test mapping, candidate deduplication, and model batch
  packing, and memoize the pure path-glob and redaction helpers.
- Fix the omitted-obligation count when the global cap collapses overflowing high-risk behaviors
  into one grouped review obligation. The synthetic obligation replaces a generated one, so the
  previous count under-reported the omission by one. Canonical scope and the Markdown scope line
  now report the corrected number; all other output is unchanged.
- Make `SemanticCandidate` immutable and give it explicit `path`/`symbol` fields instead of deriving
  them from `evidence[0]`. Merging re-sorts evidence, so a candidate could previously change the
  identity that deduplication and batching had already keyed on.
- Decouple `ast_diff/` from `git_diff/` behind the new `source.py` `SourceRevisionPair` contract, and
  pass AST safety budgets as an explicit `AstBudget` instead of resolving them through a cached
  self-import of the package. `git_diff/` likewise calls its process runner directly.
- Merge the three per-`BehaviorCategory` tables in `scoring`, `obligations`, and `test_mapper` into
  one `taxonomy.py` registry whose completeness is checked at import and pinned by a contract test.
- Narrow `score_risk`, `generate_obligations`, and the candidate classifiers to the configuration
  they actually read, and trim both package `__init__` exports to the pipeline-facing surface,
  removing nine backward-compatible aliases that existed only for tests.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-18

- Add the read-only `analyze_semantic_diff` Hermes tool.
- Add bounded committed Git collection, Python AST structural comparison, deterministic behavior
  rules, structured Hermes-hosted interpretation, static candidate-test mapping, test obligations,
  risk/confidence scoring, and JSON/Markdown transports.
- Add safe configuration, path containment, secret redaction, deterministic fallback, packaging,
  CI, and automated evaluation support.
- Complete conservative rename matching, parse-incomplete unknown findings, critical-path resource
  prioritization, bounded README/model context, schema retry/reconciliation limits, and explicit scope
  truncation reporting.
- Expand the corpus, enforce overall and critical-module coverage policy, add a full-pipeline
  performance fixture, and add clean-wheel plus real Hermes 0.14.0/0.18.2 discovery gates.
- Complete return-annotation signature detection, method/module inventory, overload preservation,
  cross-file symbol moves, semantic obligation merging, shared-call LLM batching, and aggregate
  candidate-test index bounds; expand the reviewed corpus to 17 cases.
- License the project under MIT.
